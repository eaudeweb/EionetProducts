Policies for the main ZWiki repository
======================================

In this code repository we recommend the following policies:

- This is the official Zwiki project "trunk" repo, used for the
  monthly Zwiki product releases and for running zwiki.org. The url is
  http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki . A darcsweb interface is available at
  http://joyful.com/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=ZWiki;a=summary .

- Contributors to this repo should read and sign CONTRIBUTORS.txt,
  which describes this repo's copyright and license policy.

- To submit patches, use darcs send (or if you need the full url:
  darcs send http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki). Patches are forwarded to
  Simon Michael for approval.

- Patches digitally signed by approved committers are applied 
  immediately.

- (when I get this working..) Patches which would cause unit tests to
  fail are rejected.
