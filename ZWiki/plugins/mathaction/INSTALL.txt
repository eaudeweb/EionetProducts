Installing LatexWiki (Standalone)

  1. Make sure that you have the required components installed. 
     This product requires:

     * "Zope":http://www.zope.org 2.6 or later
     
     * Python 2.2 or later

     * the "ZWiki Zope product":http://www.zwiki.org 0.32 or later

     * the "LocalFS":http://www.easyleading.org/Downloads/ Zope product

     * Ghostscript 6.0.5 or later with PDF and PNG support

     * A working LaTeX installation including latex and dvips

     * The "Python Imaging Library":http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

     In debian you can::

       apt-get install tetex-base tetex-bin tetex-extra gs zope python2.2-imaging

     ZWiki and LocalFS must be installed manually.  (Just untar them into the Products
     directory, similar to step 2)

  2. Unpack the LatexWiki distribution into your Zope installation's
     Products directory (usually /usr/lib/zope/lib/python/Products) with a
     command such as::

       tar -zxvf LatexWiki-0.32.tar.gz

  3. If you do not already have a Wiki, create one by going to the Zope
     management interface and selecting ZWiki from the pulldown in the
     upper right.  For "Type", select "latexwiki".

Installing LatexWiki in Plone (See also: "PloneAndCMF":http://zwiki.org/Chapter13PloneAndCMF)

  1. Do steps 1 and 2 above.

  2. Install the CMF Quick Installer (included with Plone 2.0)
  
  3. Create a 'Plone Site' from the dropdown in the ZMI.

  4. Add a 'CMF Quick Installer' tool to your new plone site.

  5. Click on this new plone_cmfquickinstaller node in the ZMI.  You should see
      both ZWiki and LatexWiki.  Install both.  
      
  6. Create a ZWiki Page.  You will have to press shift-reload in your browser
     when viewing this new page in order to get the new latexwiki stylesheets
     that get installed in step 5.

I recommend removing one of the two sidebars in Plone.  LatexWiki requires a
somewhat large font to make latex readable, which looks bad when put into
Plone's narrow document window between two sidebars.  

    To do this: 

        1. Go to your plone folder in the ZMI

        2. Click the "Properties" tab

        3. Delete the lines in either the "right_slots" or "left_slots"
           properties.
