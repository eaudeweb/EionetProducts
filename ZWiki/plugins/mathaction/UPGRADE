LatexWiki 0.25:
 * You will have to add the properties 'latex_font_size' (int),
   'latex_align_fudge' (float), 'latex_res_fudge' (float), and 'allow_dtml'
   (boolean) to your wiki folder(s).  It may be useful to create a latexwiki
   from the template (see INSTALL.txt, step 3) for comparison.

 * If you are using Ape or something else (FileSystemSite?) to allow access to
   the images/ directory, this will still work but the site template will try
   to create a LocalFS images directory.  Just delete it and replace it with
   Ape, or whatever.  Appropriate patches to Extensions/setup_latexwiki.py
   would be appreciated.

LatexWiki 0.22:

 * remove editform,  RecentChanges, SearchPage, UserOptions, IssueTracker, and
   FilterIssues if you have them.

 * You may have to modify files which make reference to any of the above pages.
   They are all now methods that can be called like:
        <a href="&dtml-wiki_page_url;/recentchanges">Recent Changes</a>

 * If you have just added the stylesheet for the first time (see INSTALL.txt),
   you may need to add:
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet">
   to your standard_wiki_header.  (Newer wikis do not have the standard_wiki_header)

 * DO NOT DOWNGRADE.  ZWiki 0.25 changes page types fundamentally, and your
   wiki will be broken if you downgrade to an older version of ZWiki.
