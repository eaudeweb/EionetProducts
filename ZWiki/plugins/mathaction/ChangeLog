Zwiki 0.56:
* added to Zwiki repo as plugins/mathaction
  mathaction is now shipped with Zwiki, as one of the standard plugins.
  I'll note the main changes I've made from the original; see the darcs
  history for full detail. After this, changes will be noted only in
  ZWiki/CHANGES.txt, probably.
* move page types to pagetypes.py
* some page type renaming & relabelling for consistency
* remove VERSION.txt
* move stxlatex experiments to a subdirectory 

mathaction-sm 0.55:
* Simplified file structure like other pagetypes/plugins
* Commented out all but the math and pamphlet page types
* Updated to work with current Zwiki; tested with 0.55
* Does not do zwiki version checking at startup
* Does not install default latexwiki wiki automatically

LatexWiki 0.33:
* Move to non-blocking I/O on our sockets (prevents a hang when a page
  contains many equations)
* In Extensions/Install.py look in both SOFTWARE_HOME and INSTANCE_HOME for
  the zwiki directory for our site template.  (Fix for Zope 2.7 / Plone 2.0)
* latexwiki.css: Check for any ZWikiPage in the folder for including
  /stylesheet, and do not include it if we are in plone (portal_factory
  exists)

LatexWiki 0.32:
* move imageDoesNotExist outside of enclosing function (fix for python 2.1?)
* Use 'dvips -o' (some dvips don't create .ps by default -- then what is it
  doing?!?!  Making souffle?!?!?!)
* Use full path for LocalFS images/
* Better escaping of equations to appear in img alt=
* Support $$eqn$$ display mode for equations
* check for itex and enable existing code if it is found.  itex 0.8 can be
  found here: http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000355.html
* add latexwiki.css.dtml which imports the default ZWiki stylesheet, and
  appropriate wikipage.pt changes.
* Created Extensions/Install.py for the CMF Quick Installer 
* Modified latexwiki.css to only include FrontPage/stylesheet if there is a
  FrontPage, and small tweaks to make latexwiki.css work with Plone.
* Rework to support new ZWiki 0.32 pagetypes layout
* Added diffform.pt so it includes latexwiki.css (will have to add others)

LatexWiki 0.29:
* Change version 0.25 -> 0.29 (to be same as ZWiki 0.29) after complaints, and
  even I screwed up the download link.

LatexWiki 0.25:
* variable font size via the folder properties "latex_font_size", 
  "latex_align_fudge", "latex_res_fudge".  Further refinements will probably
  be necessary.
* Fixed dot-chopping code so $\cdot \cdot$ doesn't generate an error.
  (Thanks to Kyle Cranmer)
* New Page Type:  ZwikiHtmlLatexPageType (HTML + LaTeX) should be able to feed
  this straight into itex2MML
* Fixed parsing of LaTeX so that $\begin{array} a \\ b \end{array}$ works
* Fixed escaping so that $\$$ works
* Be more careful using os.chdir().  We can tell LocalFS to use the relative
  directory "LatexWiki" now.  Zope sees its CLIENT_HOME by default.
* Modify ZWiki to be able to import the necessary elements of a LatexWiki site
* LatexWiki template site (ZWiki/content/latexwiki,
  LatexWiki/Extensions/setup_latexwiki.py)
* User font selection and font size adjustment in UserOptions (and
  stylesheet.css)

LatexWiki 0.24:
* Make ourselves appear first (and therefore default) in the list of possible
  document types when creating a new document.
* Added <span class="latexwiki"> to pages and a ploneCustom.css for plone
  that will get text the right size and equations aligned.
* Fixed links with equations not getting marked up.  (look for STX behavior
  differences here)  Equation color does not match link color.

LatexWiki 0.23:
* Changed to pslatex/dvipdf rather than pdflatex so that postscript specials
  work (axodraw/feynman diagrams in particular for me)
* Fixed latexWrapper importing App::ImageFile rather than PIL::ImageFile

LatexWiki 0.22:
* Update for ZWiki 0.26 (should work with 0.25 too)
* When latex gives us a blank page, bail properly. (try $\latex$)
* See the new UPGRADE file.

LatexWiki 0.21:
* \( \) syntax for in-line equations works now.  
* Fixed some issues with \[\]
* Fixed equation numbering to not mark up O(1), and typo \3->\2
* Prevent us from marking up escaped latex when it appears twice.
* Fixed python bug with buffer sizes.  When there were a large number of
  images on a page, ghostscript would hang writing to stderr (bbox run) and
  python seems to ignore the buffer size argument to popen3.  Changed to a
  poll/read loop.

LatexWiki 0.20:
* Added stylesheet.css
* Updated INSTALL.txt to reflect ZWiki 0.23 install procedure, and stylesheet
  use instead of standard_zwiki_header.
* Found VERSION.txt, and updated it.
* Updated __init__.py to be compatible with ZWiki 0.23 (thanks to Drew).
* Prevent us from trying to render 0x0 pngs (which causes an error the first
  time it happens).  Now we render a 1x1 transparent png.
* Change the Ghostscript resolution 130 -> 126.  The characters look better,
  the 'Y' doesn't have tits on the top, and lower case letters are larger (!)
  and line up with the text better.
* Fix the \[ \] in-line LaTeX mode. (is a block mode)
* Fix equation numbers when they appear at the end of a file.

10/3/2003 Release
* Add equation numbers with internal hyperlinks.
* Fixed rendering of images multiple times when the same equation appears more than once.
* Fixed block equations to not have extra space after the equation.
* Used PIL and 'gs -sDEVICE=bbox' to modify png's so that they line up with
  the surrounding text.
* Removed extra space after block images
* Fixed bad indenting of lists that contained block equations
* Fixed escaping: latex can be preceeded by a '!' to prevent it from being
  rendered as LaTeX.
* Use alpha channel PNG's, so that equations look right no matter what
  background your page has.
* Fix the replacement of dollar signs '$' when the same in-line equation
  occurs twice.  Escaped in-line equations now have the dollar signs converted
  to HTML entities &#36;
* Commented out code that adds the original latex for a block equation in an
  html comment <!-- \begin{equation}... etc --> so that LatexWiki doesn't
  destroy existing comments.  We still mark up equations inside HTML comments
