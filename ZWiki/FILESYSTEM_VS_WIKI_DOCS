Clarify the role of filesystem and wiki docs


Filesystem
----------
faster for one developer wielding a text editor
or several devs who are good with darcs
revision controlled - secure, trackable
can work offline
can get out of sync, uncommited changes here and there
can be auto-generated - epydoc, test output, author stats etc.
can be published (but not edited directly) online
less visible and less pretty for readers
better than wiki for large single documents

current uses:

CHANGES - release notes, also published at zwiki.org/ReleaseNotes
CONTRIBUTORS - official contributor list
GPL, LICENSE - license and copyright status
REPOPOLICY - copyright and other developer policies for this repo
README_tests - developer test documentation
README - basic product info
TODO - project plans & todos
other READMEs - basic info for each directory
plugins/latexwiki/LICENSE.txt,NOTES.txt,README.txt - latexwiki-specific copyright info, dev notes, admin/user notes
plugins/mathaction/INSTALL.txt,LICENSE.txt,Notes,README.txt,UPGRADE - needs consolidation like the above
TESTRESULTS - unit test output updated hourly, published at zwiki.org/TestResults
misc/ - public notes & snippets, published but not committed
MYNOTES/ - simon's notes & snippets, not published
MYNOTES/RelNotesTemplate - template for CHANGES


Wiki
----
slower to view and slower to edit
more accessible and more editable for a wide audience
one master copy used by everyone - simple
no special tools needed
email integration - notification and mailin
good for indexing and searching many documents (local and google search)
formatting aids - table of contents, headings, tables
more effort to protect and maintain; more vulnerable to decay
more expensive to host - every page takes memory & speed
more public - indexed quickly, for ever
can organize a large number of documents in a hierarchy

current uses:
 
zwiki.org, including
NextReleaseNewsDraft - unused
GeneralDiscussion
InternationalisationDiscussion
IssueTracker
plone.demo.zwiki.org
free zwikis, including kpug zope3 docs, leo, etc.
zopewiki.org, joyful.com etc.


Thoughts
--------
filesystem for developers, wiki for users/admins/general public
use text files anywhere for fast developer notes
one requirement, keep them current - but what to do with old/temporary notes ?
no special docs directory, just upper-case, no suffix
publish all filesystem docs online, like rdoc or within wiki (they will be googlable ?)
restructured text and moving docs between FS and wiki encouraged
wiki needs to be fast
