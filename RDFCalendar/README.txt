RDFCalendar

  Styling

    The application provides you with a suggestion for a stylesheet to add to
    your sitewide stylesheet.

  Changing the default style

    You can create your own style for the RDFCalendar by creating a Page Template
    with the id "style_css" in your RDFCalendar and adding CSS information to it.

    You can use the default style found in \Products\RDFCalendar\dtml\default_css.dtml
    of your Zope instance, or the one at https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/repositories/Zope/trunk/RDFCalendar/dtml/default_css.dtml
    as a starting point for your customized style.
