Parse entities:
Sometime the link contains &amp; escapes. Sometimes just raw &'s as CDATA.
The only way I can deal with this without problems, is if I parse all
entitities (&amp; and &#38; etc.) and store the raw data in the file in UTF-8
format. Then you would be sure you could use <dtml-var link html_quote>
without any surprises.
