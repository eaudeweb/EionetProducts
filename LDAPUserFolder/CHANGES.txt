    2.7 (2006/07/20)

      Bugs fixed

        * Sidnei da Silva took the time to root out any use of mutable
          variables in method argument lists.

      Features:

        * Completely refactored the way searches are handled by the 
          FakeLDAP testing fixture. The new code uses intelligent parsing
          to make sense of a query and apply it in a generic way instead
          of trying to sniff a filter to guess where the query came from
          and what the query was attempting to do. Kudos for a whole
          bunch of time spent go to Sidnei da Silva.

        * Added a more powerful groups search method named searchGroups
          to improve group searching capabilities for e.g. Plone and
          PlonePAS. Wichert Akkerman provided code and tests.

        * Added a more powerful user search method named searchUsers.
          Unlike findUser, searchUsers allows for more than one attribute
          to be searched on. findUser has been reduced to a simple wrapper
          around searchUsers. My thanks for inspiration and an initial
          implementation suggestion go to Wichert Akkerman.

      Other:

        * Enabled utils.to_utf8 to handle unicode (continuing work on
          http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00480)

        * The use of zLOG, and the SimpleLog module, have been removed
          in favor of using the Python logging module throughout.

        * Software dependencies are now listed concisely in one place,
          a new DEPENDENCIES.txt file.


    2.7-beta (2006/03/02)

      Bugs fixed:

        * Harden SimpleLog against cases where the log message included
          strings like %s, caught by Wichert Akkerman.
          (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00491)

        * In ActiveDirectory, it is possible to have records (specifically
          internal system accounts) that have the correct objectClasses to
          qualify as user records, but they lack the attribute designated as
          the chosen UID attribute. Thanks to Wichert Akkerman, these are now 
          disregarded. (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00484)

        * Make sure objectGUID, when set on the LDAPUser as a property,
          gets treated specially (discovered by Wichert Akkerman in the
          course of clarifying http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00480)

        * The SimpleLog.zLOGLogger log method ignored the *args parameter
          (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00474, thanks go to 
          Mark Hammond)

        * Repaired warings appearing in Zope 2.8.5 due to a couple typos
          in security declarations.

        * Fix breakage when local groups storage is used and no groups are
          assigned to a user: When roles are changed to another empty value
          an error occurred (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00478 by
          Junyong Pan)
