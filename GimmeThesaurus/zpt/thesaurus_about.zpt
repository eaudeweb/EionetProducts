<h2 id="preface" class="about-header">Preface to the 2004 version of GEMET</h2>

<p class="about-text">
This version of GEMET is an extension of the
2001 version of GEMET. It includes the Czech, Estonian and Polish
translations as national contributions and the entire content is
embedded in a modern Internet application. Definitions are available in
English and the Bulgarian, Russian and Slovenian translations are added.
The application is browsable through this GUI and it is also available
as a webservice for those who want to link it to their application. How
to do this is explained under &ldquo;GEMET web service&rdquo;.  The content of GEMET
will need quality assurance around various terms over time. This is part
of another initiative which is about to provide GEMET as open content
in the WIKI set of Internet services (Wiktionary ...).
</p>

<p class="about-text">Please take a look at the text below for information on
how GEMET was built, which will inform you about usage and limitations.
</p>

<h3>Preface of the 2001 version:</h3>
<p class="about-text">For the 6th time since 1996 there is a new
edition of GEMET, being the reference vocabulary of the European
Environment Agency (EEA) and its Network (Eionet). The present version
of the controlled vocabulary provides Bulgarian, Russian and Slovenian
as new languages.
This could be achieved through the kind co-operation with National
Focal points and other expert organisations in these countries. These
translations are contribution of the countries to EEA's work programme
and have been financed through national funds or with additional funds
from outside the EEA scheme.
As special remark has to be made regarding the Russian version due to the
fact that Russia is not part of Eionet. The translation of GEMET terms
into Russian has been funded by the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) and carried out in the International Centre for Scientific and
Technical Information within a respective Memorandum of Understanding.
The 2001 version of GEMET also incorporates changes provided for the
Portuguese and Swedish language. It also sees an inclusion of the Basque
(Euskara) language into the ThesShow browser - this inclusion has not
been possible in the year 2000 version.
The EEA highly appreciates all these contributions.
The content of GEMET has not been changed to assure consistency in use
between the versions. There are plans to include more European languages
in the years to come as well as to perform a thorough evaluation of
the content.
</p>

<h2 id="chapter-I" class="about-header">1. Introduction to GEMET</h2>
<p class="about-text">
GEMET, the GEneral Multilingual Environmental
Thesaurus, has been developed as an indexing, retrieval and control tool
for the European Topic Centre on Catalogue of Data Sources (ETC/CDS)
and the European Environment Agency (EEA), Copenhagen. The work has been
carried out through a contract between the EEA and the ETC/CDS which is
led by the Ministry of the Environment of Lower Saxony, includes members
of Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden and benefits of the collaboration of
other member countries of the European Union (EU), as well as of UNEP
Infoterra.
</p>
<p class="about-text">The basic idea for the development of GEMET
was to use the best of the presently available excellent multilingual
thesauri, in order to save time, energy and funds. GEMET was conceived
as a &ldquo;general&rdquo; thesaurus, aimed to define a common general language, a
core of general terminology for the environment. Specific thesauri and
descriptor systems (e.g. on Nature Conservation, on Wastes, on Energy,
etc.) have been excluded from the first step of development of the
thesaurus and have been taken into account only for their structure and
upper level terminology.</p>
<p class="about-text">GEMET has been compiled by merging the terms of
the following multilingual documents:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		A selection of the &ldquo;<span xml:lang="de">Umwelt Thesaurus</span>&rdquo; of <span xml:lang="de">Umweltbundesamt (UBA)</span>, Berlin, 1995,
                with more than 2.000 descriptors out of 8.500 in German and English.
	</li>
	<li>
		The complete &ldquo;<span xml:lang="it">Thesaurus Italiano per l'Ambiente (TIA)</span>&rdquo;
		quadrilingual version on CD-ROM of <span xml:lang="it">Consiglio Nazionale delle
		Ricerche (CNR)</span>, Rome, 1994, with more than 4.000 descriptors
		in Italian, English, Dutch and German and a selection of
		more than 2.000 descriptors of this thesaurus, compiled as a
		Classification Scheme for the MET of the EEA, 1995 (see the
		following No. 3).
	</li>
	<li>
		The complete &ldquo;Multilingual Environment Thesaurus (MET)&rdquo; of
		<span xml:lang="nl">Nederlands Bureau voor Onderzoek Informatie (NBOI)</span>, Amsterdam,
		developed on the Dutch &ldquo;Milieu-thesaurus&rdquo; for the EEA in 1995,
		with more than 2.300 descriptors in Dutch, Danish, English,
		French, German, Italian, Norwegian and Spanish.
	</li>
	<li>
		The complete &ldquo;EnVoc Thesaurus&rdquo;, of UNEP Infoterra, 1997
		edition, with about 2.000 descriptors in English, French and
		Spanish, with possibility of access to Arabic, Chinese and
		Russian. 
	</li>
	<li>
		The complete &ldquo;<span xml:lang="es">Thesaurus de Medio Ambiente</span>&rdquo; on CD-ROM of
		<span xml:lang="es">Ministerio de Obras Publicas, Transportes y Medio Ambiente
		(MOPTMA)</span>, Madrid, 1995, with more than 2.600 descriptors in
		Spanish, English, French, German.
	</li>
	<li>
		The complete &ldquo;<span xml:lang="fr">Lexique environnement - Plan&egrave;te</span>&rdquo;, of
		the <span xml:lang="fr">Minist&egrave;re de l'environnement</span>, Paris, 1995, with more
		than 5.000 descriptors in French and English.
	</li>
	<li>
		Descriptors of relevant documents of the EEA, namely &ldquo;Europe's
		Environment, The Dobris Assessment&rdquo;, the &ldquo;DPSIR Data Flow Scheme&rdquo;,
		as well as terminology of ETCs and Eionet, in English.
	</li>
	<li>
		Descriptors of the &ldquo;Thesaurus Eurovoc&rdquo; of the European
		Parliament, Brussels, 1996, in French, English, Dutch, German,
		Italian, and Spanish, with possibility of access to Danish,
		Greek, and Portuguese.
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="about-text">The merging has been performed both on conceptual
and formal basis. Coinciding concepts in the different thesauri have
been identified and scored. Like in other multilingual thesauri,
e. g. Infoterra EnVoc, a neutral alphanumerical notation allows the
identification of a concept independently on the user's language.</p>

<p class="about-text">The links with the original thesauri are ensured
by the respective identifiers or code notations.</p>

<p class="about-text">Following the identification of the coinciding
concepts, a selection was made by the experts of the National Focal
Points of the organisations involved. </p>

<p class="about-text">The resulting 6.562 terms have been arranged
in a classification scheme made of 3 super-groups, 30 groups plus 5
accessory, instrumental groups. Each descriptor has been arranged in a
hierarchical structure headed by a Top Term. The level of poly-hierarchy,
i.e. the allocation of a descriptor to more than one group, has been
kept to a minimum. Further, to allow a thematic retrieval of terms
thematically related but scattered in different groups, a set of 40
themes have been agreed upon with the EEA and each descriptor has been
assigned to as many themes as necessary. Thus, the user can access the
thesaurus through the group-hierarchical list, through the thematic list
or through the alphabetical list. As a complement to the hierarchical
&ldquo;vertical&rdquo; relations, an exhaustive series of strong &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;
relations between terms (RT, Related Terms) have been introduced. A
progressive Line Number has been assigned to each descriptor of the
systematic list, in order to help the user of the lists to identify the
descriptor in the different lists. The Line Number is merely a neutral
identifier for the present version.
</p>

<p class="about-text">The GEMET size, formerly figured at about 200000
descriptors, rose to more than 5.000 in the course of merging, due to
the limited overlapping between the different thesauri, to constraints
of the selection work carried out by the parental organisations and to
a few new additions, mainly from CDS indexing work.
</p>

<p class="about-text">The present version 2001 of GEMET is the result of
a close collaboration between CNR and UBA under contract and supervision
of the ETC/CDS. It presents 5.298 descriptors, including 109 Top Terms,
and 1.264 synonyms in English. The 5.524 terms belonging to the parental
thesauri and not included in GEMET, constitute an accessory alphabetical
list of free terms.
</p>

<p class="about-text">British English has been proposed as language
of choice for the EEA, but the American English equivalents have been
added through a collaboration with the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).
</p>

<p class="about-text">The present Version 2001 of GEMET provides a
complete numerical equivalence (all the descriptors have an equivalent)
with the following languages: Basque, Bulgarian, Dutch, Finnish, French,
German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian
and Spanish. For Danish, Slovak, Swedish and Greek some few descriptors
are still missing - this issue is presently under work. The semantic
equivalence (correct correspondence of meaning between languages) has been
separately ensured by the NFPs experts for Dutch, French, German, Italian,
Norwegian, Portuguese and almost completely for Spanish. Equivalence in
Finnish is not yet validated.
The translation of GEMET into other languages, both extra-EU and
extra-European is foreseen in the future.
</p>

<p class="about-text">The need to ensure the internal systematic and
linguistic coherence of the thesaurus led the GEMET Working Group to
foster the endowment of all the descriptors with a consistent set of
definitions. There are at present more than 4.000 definitions available,
which provide a useful glossary function where the semantic of the
thesaurus structure might not be completely caught. The sources of
definitions are presented in Annex 1.
</p>

<p class="about-text">GEMET follows the ISO norms on monolingual and multilingual thesauri.
</p>

<p class="about-text">The thesaurus material, i.e. the terms and
their control elements, is managed by the THESmain program, developed
by the TBHS, Technisches B&uuml;ro Hermann Stallbaumer, Vienna,
which provides a series of sophisticated functions for handling the
poly-hierarchical, poly-thematic and multilingual aspects. The use of
GEMET in THESmain is restricted to the developers of the thesaurus,
but a user-friendly software program, THESshow (Windows95/98,
NT 4.0), is available for the visualisation of GEMET for the lay
user. In order to receive ThesShow, please contact the ETC/CDS at <a
href="http://www.mu.niedersachsen.de">http://www.mu.niedersachsen.de</a>.
From end of 2001, please contact the EEA's Information
Centre via e-mail information.centre@eea.europa.eu or at <a
href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/">http://www.eea.europa.eu/</a>
</p>

<p class="about-text">The thesaurus is part of WinCDS - MS-Access based
data collection tool for the Catalogue of Data Sources, where it is used
for indexing. A further software, GenThes, has been developed for the
ETC/CDS by FZI, Forschungszentrum Informatik, Karlsruhe, in order to
present GEMET in the Web environment. It functions as Java application
to support expert retrieval on the Internet database WebCDS the Catalogue
of environment related addresses and data sources.

<h2 id="chapter-II" class="about-header">2. Criteria for the allocation of terms to the groups and themes of GEMET</h2>
<p class="about-text">GEMET has two systems for arranging the descriptors:
</p>

<p class="about-text">A classification scheme of 3 super-groups
containing 30 groups; there are in addition 5 accessory groups of terms,
instrumental to the thesaurus use.
The super-groups have been adopted to approach an environmental management
perspective and to help the hierarchical structuring of GEMET. The groups
reflect a systematic, category- or discipline-oriented perspective. Within
the groups, the descriptors are basically allocated in a mono-hierarchical
order, but several descriptors needed to be allocated to more than one
group or to more than a broader term inside the same group, thus creating
a condition of poly-hierarchy.
</p>

<p class="about-text">Hierarchical relationships are either:
</p>

<p class="about-text"> generic relationships (the narrower term has all the characteristics of the broader term and at least one additional characteristic)
</p>

<p class="about-text">Example:</p>

<table>
<col style="width: 4em"/>
<col style="width: 2em"/>
<col style="width: 11em"/>
<tr>
    <td colspan="3">trees</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>deciduous trees</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>conifers</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="about-text"> or whole-part relationships (the narrower term must be part of the broader term)
</p>

<p class="about-text">Example:
</p>

<table>
<col style="width: 4em"/>
<col style="width: 2em"/>
<col style="width: 11em"/>
<tr>
    <td colspan="3">trees</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>tree trunks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>treetops</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="about-text">If both generic and whole-part relationships exist
in connection with a term, this results in a poly-dimensional subdivision.
For the sake of clarity and taking into consideration that GEMET deals
mainly with generic relationships, both relationships are treated as
equals in the thesaurus.
</p>

<p class="about-text">Example:</p>

<table>
<col style="width: 4em"/>
<col style="width: 2em"/>
<col style="width: 11em"/>
<tr>
    <td colspan="3">trees</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>tree trunks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>treetops</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>deciduous trees</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>NT</td><td>conifers</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="about-text"> Hierarchical relationships exist between terms
belonging to the same logical categories.  Every term can possess several
broader terms (polyhierarchy)
</p>

<p class="about-text">Example:</p>

<table>
<col style="width: 4em"/>
<col style="width: 2em"/>
<col style="width: 11em"/>
<tr>
    <td colspan="3">sulphuric acid</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>BT</td><td>sulphur compounds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td><td>BT</td><td>acid</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="about-text">A thematic order, containing 40 themes.
These themes have been established according to practical considerations,
corresponding to the information needs. They have been developed to
reflect the EEA activities in order to support the thematic elements of
the EEA DPSIR Dataflow Scheme. The list of themes has taken into account
all the main topics of the Scheme, of The Dobris Assessment and of other
sources, like ETCs (European Topic Centres) and Eionet (Environmental
Information and Observation Network). They can be used as checklists when
dealing with environmental matters. The themes, being complementary to
the groups, confer to the thesaurus a matrix structure.
</p>

<p class="about-text">The main principles followed for the allocation of descriptors were:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		A descriptor is usually allocated to one group;
	</li>
	<li>
		When necessary, a descriptor can be assigned to more than one group or to more than a broader term inside the same group (poly-hierarchy).
	</li>
	<li>
		A descriptor can be allocated to more than one theme (&ldquo;poly-thematic&rdquo; condition).
	</li>
	<li>
		A descriptor should be allocated to all the (relevant) themes to which it belongs.
	</li>
	<li>
		All descriptors belonging to a &ldquo;Group&rdquo; of GEMET whose name and content corresponds to a &ldquo;Theme&rdquo; will be allocated to that theme.
	</li>
	<li>
		The non-descriptors (synonyms) are linked to their descriptors.
	</li>
	<li>
		Descriptors with very general content or those which do not belong exactly to a theme, have been collected in a theme of general character, called &ldquo;no special theme&rdquo; (theme: general).
	</li>
	<li>
		According to the development of GEMET, additional themes might be identified.
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="about-text">The allocation of a descriptor to more than one
theme reflects the relation of this term to different subject fields.
A non-descriptor, being synonym to a descriptor, belongs to the same
group or theme as the descriptor. The synonym guides the user directly to
the preferred term, where s/he will find all the necessary information:
the fundamental relations like equivalence, hierarchical and associative
relationship, and so on.
</p>

<p class="about-text">Unlike in some parental thesauri, the singular
form of terms has been preferred throughout the whole thesaurus; only
a limited number of terms have been kept in plural form, to prevent
change of meaning or to follow the rules of the English language. For
the non-English languages, the translators are recommended to follow the
same criterion used for English, but are left free to adopt a different
form if the meaning of the term is at stake.
All the complementary numerical forms (singular to plural, plural to
singular) of the terms which can be endowed with such forms, have been
entered into the thesaurus file; nevertheless, they will be presented
only when they are alphabetically distant from the form presented (e.g.:
man _ men).
</p>

<p class="about-text">The thesaurus has also been analysed for
the presence of alternate forms and spelling variants, including
the prepositional forms. The analysis was restricted to the English
equivalents proposed by the parental thesauri, thus it was not
extended to the rest of the terms. All these forms have been entered as
non-descriptors (synonyms).
</p>

<p class="about-text">The themes have provided the basis for the work on associative relationships (RT, Related Terms).
</p>

<p class="about-text">Because of the restricted use of hierarchical
relationships there was a need for another mechanism to draw attention
to other terms which an indexer and a searcher should consider. These
are RELATED TERMS of the starting term.
Associative relationships between terms are relationships which do not
correspond to the criteria of hierarchy or equivalence. Associative
relationships can be established between terms belonging to different
logical categories.
From the numerous possible relationships only those relationships
are included in GEMET which are considered useful for indexing and
searching.
</p>

<p class="about-text">Related terms may be of several kinds:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Objects and the discipline in which they are studied, such as Animals and Zoology.</li>
	<li>Processes and their products, such as Environmental Policy and Environmental Law.</li>
	<li>Tools and the processes in which they are used, such as Paint brushes and Painting.</li>
	<li>The Related Term relationship is also used between terms which are of the same kind, not hierarchically related, but where someone looking for one ought also to consider searching under the other, e.g. Beds RT Bedding; Quilts RT Feathers</li>
	<li>Relationship of opposites (antonymy) such as risks and safety</li>
	<li>Relationship between a determinant term and a specifying characteristic such as sulphuric acid production and sulphuric acid</li>
	<li>Relationship between functional or causal connections:
process - equipment such as pulverization and shredder
resources - function such as organic phosphorus compounds and insecticides
cause - effect such as soil acidification and forest damage
measure - target such as pesticides and pests</li>
</ul>

<p class="about-text">The established principles will produce a better
performance of the indexers when preparing input for the CDS and will
allow easier access to the data for the users via the descriptors.
</p>

<p class="about-text"><strong>Important Note.</strong> The
classification scheme of GEMET, by groups, themes and hierarchies,
should be considered merely as a mean to control the thesaurus terms
and the semantic relations between them; in other words, as a way to
control the internal coherence of the thesaurus. As such, it is not
proposed as a general reference pattern for the organisation of any
specific environmental information system, although its structure and
comprehensive set of meta-concepts (mainly the themes and the top terms)
can be fruitfully used  for such purpose.
</p>


<h2 id="chapter-III" class="about-header"> 3. How to use the Thesaurus</h2>

<p class="about-text"> To find the appropriate term, the user has
several chances to navigate in the different parts of GEMET:
</p>

<p class="about-text"> 1. Have a look to the &ldquo;Systematic List of
Descriptors&rdquo;, which guides you from the super-groups and groups to the
descriptors and their hierarchical relations
</p>
<p class="about-text">or
</p>
<p class="about-text"> 2. Enter the &ldquo;Thematic List of Descriptors&rdquo;,
indicating the various themes and the descriptors allocated to these
themes in an alphabetic order
</p>
<p class="about-text">or
</p>
<p class="about-text"> 3. Consult the &ldquo;Alphabetic List of Terms&rdquo;,
containing descriptors, definitions, scope notes, synonyms and the
allocation of the terms to groups and themes
</p>
<p class="about-text">or
</p>
<p class="about-text"> 4. Another chance to access is, using the
&ldquo;Concordance&rdquo; list which presents as entry terms also the internal words
of a phrase or compound term, indicating  the preferred terms.
</p>

<p class="about-text"> In the &ldquo;Alphabetic List of Terms&rdquo;, descriptors
are presented in bold type; different themes belonging to one descriptor
are separated by a semicolon.
</p>

<p class="about-text"> In the &ldquo;Alphabetic List of Terms&rdquo; and in
the &ldquo;Concordance List&rdquo;, Non-Descriptors (synonyms) are printed in
italics.

<h2 id="chapter-VI" class="about-header"> 6. Presentation of GEMET Version 2001</h2>

<p class="about-text"> After the distribution of different intermediate
versions, GEMET versions 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 have been subjected to
an extensive work by CNR and UBA that led to the version 2.0. More
translations and some corrections formed version 2000. Aiming at
completing the European languages in GEMET, Basque, Bulgarian, Russian
and the Slovenian language could be added to this version. No changes
have been performed regarding the term count or the hierarchy. Please
find a report on this work in Annex 4.
</p>

<p class="about-text"> The remarks and suggestions provided by the
colleagues of Belgium, Sweden, Portugal, Norway, Austria, France, by
the ETC for Nature Conservation and by US EPA and by UNEP GRID Geneva
have been taken into account. Most of them have been applied to GEMET,
to the extent they were not interfering with:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The limits established by the selection of terms by the national experts;</li>
	<li>The present balance between the group and the thematic structure. </li>
</ul>

<p class="about-text"> The resulting version presents:
</p>

<ul class="about-text">
	<li>The complete allocation of descriptors to groups;</li>
	<li>The poly-hierarchical set-up;</li>
	<li>The complete allocation of descriptors to themes;</li>
	<li>An extensive set of synonyms in English, which include the
	alternate forms, the spelling variants and the prepositional
	forms;</li>
	<li>An extended range of Related Terms;</li>
	<li>A consistent number of definitions;</li>
	<li>A certain number of parenthetic qualifiers, consistently adopted
	for overall disambiguation purposes, both in British and American
	English.</li>
</ul>

<p class="about-text">The following table summarises the structural elements of GEMET.
